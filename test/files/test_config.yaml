# Threads
# Specify the number of concurrent threads to run. The higher the
# number, the more files will be downloaded and processed at the
# same time, but will use more system resources. A good rule of 
# thumb is to set this value equal to the number of available 
# processor cores.
threads: 4

# Download limit
# A Redis dataset must not exceed the amount of available RAM.
# If you are working with limited resources, it would be necessary
# to set a download size limit to prevent Omg-Agg from overloading
# the server. feed.omgili.com has roughly 15GB of compressed data
# available at any one time, which translates to ~37.5GB (250%)
# uncompressed. If you don't have that much RAM, set a download
# limit here, in megabytes.
# Use this algorithm to help: (Available_RAM / 2.5)
download_limit: 4000
